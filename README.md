# MarginSymbols

This [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) plugin toggles 'Include in Instances' property for Symbols whose names begin with 'Margin'.

If you are creating Symbols to represent margins (I'll call it Margin Symbols), this plugin is best if you want to toggle Margin Symbols visibility.

## Install

- Downloads latest plugin from [here](https://github.com/griffin-stewie/MarginSymbols/releases/latest).
- Unzip it, and doble click `MarginSymbols.sketchplugin`

## How it works

1. Select Artbord or Symbol that conforms to the naming convention
2. Run commands from menu Plugins > Margin Symbols
    - "Show All Margin Symbols"
    - "Hide All Margin Symbols"
    - "Show Selected Margin Symbols"
    - "Hide Selected Margin Symbols"

This plugin has Lock/Unlock feature as well.

- "Lock All Margin Symbols"
- "Unlock All Margin Symbols"

## Naming convention for Margin Symbol

Symbols that you want to toggle visibility should named begin with `margin`.
